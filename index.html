										<h2 class="major">INTRO</h2>
										<p>I'm Jayden and I'm a certified strength and nutrition coach. I'm a geologist by trade, but fitness is what I'm actually good at. I'm obsessed with movement, so I guess you can call me a nerd of sorts. A bit about myself, currently my training revolves around olympic weightlifting, but previously I've trained in bodybuilding and powerlifting. I love pineapples and I will fight anyone who says pineapples don't belong on pizza, because they belong on everything!! If you wanna connect more with me, feel free to chedck out my Instagram @jaydotse :')

										<h2 class="major">MY GOAL</h2>
										<p>My goal as a coach is to help you become the best version of yourself. That means having the sick physique you've always wanted, enjoying training, eating like a king, being a functional, mobile human being, and learning all the why's behind all the do's so you can make educated choices for yourself. I see too many "coaches" with no credentials offering subpar service, so I want to make sure I hold you accountable to all your goals. If you're interested in working with me, send me an e-mail and we'll set up a consultation call and see if we're a good fit for each other! Look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

										<h2 class="major">My Story</h2>
										<p>If you're familiar with Asian culture, you'll know that being anything apart from skinny is highly frowned upon. I tried to stay within this skinny box for around 18 years and had a lot of side eyes cast at me when I started to pack on muscle. It was after my first terrible break up that I started to invest in myself and commmit to the gym. Within a relationship where I had no control, it was in fitness that I found myself again. Needless to say I wouldn't give this up for anything! 7 years later, I can say it was the best decision I've ever made. Now I want to change as many lives as possible and help others achieve their potential.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Programs/What I offer?!</h2>
									<p>Here, you can take a look at all the packages I offer. There's something that works for everyone. With all my monthly program clients, you have 24/7 access to my cell and can fire any questions you have at me. I will respond within 24 hours. You can check in as much or as little as you'd like, but daily will give you the best results.</p>
									<section class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/full.png"/></a>
										
											<p>This is the ultimate package. Full mobility, nutrition, and workout programming. I require you to send me videos of your exercises so I can accurately program for your needs. No cookie cutter bullshit here, just raw, science backed programs. 300$/Month</p>
										
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/custom.png" alt="" /></a>
								
											<p>Don't want help with nutrition and just want to workout? No problem. I will custom write you a program according to your goals. Videos will also be sent to show you how to perform exercises if they're new to you. 150$/Month</p>
										
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/nutrition.png" alt="" /></a>
									
											<p>Like the current program you're on, but just want guidance on how to eat? I got you as well. Custom meal plans and macro coaching available. 150$/Month or 100$/Plan</p>
										
										</article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/mobility.png" alt="" /></a>
										
											<p>Mobility is more than just banded pull aparts, dumbbell rotations, and stretching. Grinds my gears when I see "gurus" talk about mobility and all they do is take a dowel and start spinning. Mobility limitations can result in injuries when you try to force the body into a range it doesn't have. I will write and give you specific mobilzation exercises as warmups according to your training routine to help you excel at your sport. Videos will be sent to show you how to properly perform these drills. 150$/Program</p>
